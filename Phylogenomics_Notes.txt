This is notes/work flow for our project.
Step 1:

Week of Feb. 5 to-do tasks:
Emily: Read about Haploview, determine if we need to ask for PERL script
Lauren: Lauren will do some things
Ellie: Read about PCAs, EIGENSOFT software, and determine if the database is the low or high coverage SNPs. Make folders: data, data_output, scripts, figures, documents.
