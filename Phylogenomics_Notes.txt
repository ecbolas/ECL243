This is notes/work flow for our project.
Step 1:
LD: Emily
PCA: Ellie (only high coverage)
Structure: Lauren
If time, start on one of the demographic analyses. 

Week of Feb. 5 to-do tasks:
Emily: Read about Haploview, determine if we need to ask for PERL script
Lauren: Lauren will do some things, Yes
Ellie: Read about PCAs, EIGENSOFT software, and determine if the database is the low or high coverage SNPs. Make folders: data, data_output, scripts, figures, documents.  

Week of Feb. 5 Updates
Ellie: Done making folders

Ellie: 99% certain the databases are high coverage SNPs. Hovering the mouse over them me shows a file description that says polar_bear.pooled.snp.txt.gz  has 18 polar bears and the brown bear file has 10. The low coverage data is for all 79 polar bears, but they only did high coverage for 18 bears, so this should be what we need to use. Also, when we open the files, we can compare information with table s2, which lists the high sequence individuals, including what depth they were sequenced at and a high coverage ID.

Ellie: EIGENSOFT: https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/alkes-price/eigensoft-frequently-asked-questions/, https://github.com/DReichLab/EIG
The EIGENSOFT package combines functionality from our population genetics methods (Patterson et al. 2006) and our EIGENSTRAT stratification correction method (Price et al. 2006). The EIGENSTRAT method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls along continuous axes of variation; the resulting correction is specific to a candidate markerâ€™s variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations
